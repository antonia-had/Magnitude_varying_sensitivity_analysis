# Magnitude_varying_sensitivity_analysis

To perform the sensitivity analysis part, one needs access to SALib (https://salib.readthedocs.io)

LHsamples.txt contains the sampled parameter combinations for each state of the world 

historical_data.txt contains the historical output time-series

experiment_data.txt contains the model output time-series resulting from the experiment

magnitude_varying_sensitivity_analysis.py is the main analysis file that produces all plots and performs the sensitivity analysis
